Kinda like a regular expression language, but for Sprites

## Installation üíª

**‚ùó In order to start using SpritExp you must have the [Flutter SDK][flutter_install_link] installed on your machine.**

Add `spritexp` to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  spritexp:
```

Install it:

```sh
flutter packages get
```

## Using it

SpritExp basic syntax structure is the following:

```
{SPRITE COORDINATES AND SIZE}[ * MULTIPLIERS]
```

Breaking it down, coordinates and size of the sprite are informed by numbers separated by commas, and
a couple of formats are accepted:

```
// {Size} - position defaults to 0,0
{16}
// {X and Y, Width and Height}
{16, 32}
// {X, Y, Width, Height}
{0, 16, 32, 32}
```

Multipliers are meant to create a sequential list of sprites, based in a a sprite definition explained above.

So, to generate a horizontal list of 2 sprites, the following example can be used:

```
{0, 16} * 2x
```

The above will generate two sprites, the first starting at X0 Y0, with a square dimension of 16, and
the second at X16 Y0, also with the same dimension.

On the other hand, the following:
```
{0, 16} * 2y
```

Will generate two sprites, the first starting at X0 Y0, with a square dimension of 16, and
the second at X0 Y16, also with the same dimension.

You can also get a grid of sprites by adding both `x` and `y` to the expression:

```
{0, 16} * 2xy
```

By default, SpritExp assumes that multipliers are horizontal, so the `x` can be omitted, meaning
that `{0, 16} * 2` and `{0, 16} * 2x` are the same expression.
